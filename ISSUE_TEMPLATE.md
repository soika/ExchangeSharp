I have a [BUG REPORT] or [FEATURE REQUEST]

Details:

Error Logs (if any):

The more information you can provide, the better.

For new features, please donate or do a pull request. When donating, email the feature request details, coin type and tx id to exchangesharp@digitalruby.com.

Donations will help your bug to get fixed faster.

Requests for new features without a donation or pull request will be ignored due to the high volume of emails and requests. I've done hundreds of hours for free on this project to get a great baseline. I obviously can't continue to spend my time on new features without donations.
